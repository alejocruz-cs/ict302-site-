# This week in ICT 302

- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

I continued working in wordpress and learned many new things it can do
 - I can describe and compare content management systems.

This week I learned more on wordpress allowing me to have more to compare it with HUGO.
- I can manage content using established workflows.

My group added a new way to communicate. Personal Messages. We're still doing all our talks over groupme instead of TEAMS just because it's easier to navigate on phones.
 - I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
 
 I began learning new tricks for wordpress
 - I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

I discovered a new set of youtubers in web-design which may or may not help me as we get further into this course.
