# This week in ICT 302
- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
 
At the start of the semaster I thought I knew what CMS was and although I did know it to a competent degree but not to the deeper level that I know now. I now know the rolls
of content management as well as the upstanding work it takes to manage it adaquetly. I've also learned how to make money and market myself using CMS.
 
 - I can describe and compare content management systems.

Though the semaster we learned HUGO and wordpress. At first I hated Hugo because of a lack of control but I grew to love it because the more we used Wordpress the more I noticed the true
lack of control that you have over wordpress. I've learned many of their strong suits and their failures such as wordpress working better with teams or Hugo working better with custimazation.
They both get the job done but both have differnt ways of doing it. I think as my opionion changed I prefer Hugo.

- I can manage content using established workflows.

I never used workflows before, I would just get an assignment and stay awake 24 hours to finish it by "throwing darts until they stick" after using them I dont think I could go without
them as they've made my workflow both solo and with a team so much easier. I've learned to use teams and groupme for workflows which is argubaly better than teams as its more organized
but lacks the features neccesary.

 - I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

 I learned alot about using terminals to get work done as well as outside stuff such as how linux can be used to create basic server side CMS. I used that to store a bunch of code
 and notes so that I dont have to constantly refer back to the same pages on W3 when I learn something new.
 
 - I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
 I found so many youtubers and online forums that had information regarding CMS languages like HTML, CSS, PHP, and even MySQL which are all really useful to know and will help me 
 in the future when it comes to finding jobs and more. I even found help in the weirdest of places like a twitter "threadcher" of someone teaching how to do wordpress plug ins but in
 one long twitter thread which was pretty cool.
