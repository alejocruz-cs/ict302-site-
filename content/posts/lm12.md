# This week in ICT 302
- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
I learned how to make better databases as well as installing widgets to wordpress.

 - I can describe and compare content management systems.

I learned more on making websites in LINUX command line as well as how to start severs for it which is cool but I don't see myself using that method over something like this or wordpress.


- I can manage content using established workflows.

We continue to work well as a group as well as new group projects in my other classes continue to use what I've learned here.

 - I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

I messed around with wix this week just for fun and I found some cool new things in it that I didn't know before that it could do and that allowed me to enjoy it more
 
 - I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
 
I got tired of googling things all the time multiple times so I finally created a local website using a text editor and basic visuals I made in photoshop to categorize things I
often google so I don't need to anymore and have it in a way that's easily accesiblee to me.
# Extra Project Wordpress plug-ins

My group added a calander app to the wordpress site and it's pretty cool and useful for seeing old post without scrolling forever.
