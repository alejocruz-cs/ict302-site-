# This week in ICT 302

- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
This week we learned how to structure a workflow in Microsoft teams and in doing so I can now identify and define a new web content management system. Although
this isn't entirely what the "I can" statement is it's still important to know workflows so that you can manage web content better.
 - I can describe and compare content management systems.
 This past week I had to reset my PC but after doing so I thought "what if I could reset weekly without losing things?" so by using an old now archaic RTX 2070 based PC I have set it up as a personal server machine it only has 5 TB of HDD so it's not anywhere near ideal but it is good enough for backing up my save files for games as well as screenshots from those games. I suppose that fits the statement so therefore I can now describe and compare a new content management system.
 - I can manage content using established workflows.
 Similar to the first I can statement thanks to Microsoft teams I can now manage a more established workflow.
 - I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
 I can now set up simple home servers even though that wasn't part of the curriculum and I did it outside of class it still fits under this I can statement.
 - I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
 I am once again telling you about my server. I went to the all-knowing youtube and watched probably 7 hours of home setups and how to do it then followed a guide and BOOM what seemed difficult was actually quite easy.
