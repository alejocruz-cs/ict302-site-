# This week in ICT 302

- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

 This week we dived deeper into wordpress which made me more familar with it however, there was a twitter outage this week and once it came back up i did some 
 research into what caused it. It turns out in their content management system was being migrated and they accidentally triggered it early which brought the whole site down.
 
 - I can describe and compare content management systems.

I messed around in WIX this week out of curiosity. I haven't used it in a few years so there were alot of changes made that I enjoyed such as better SEO potential as well
as moreprofesional website themes. There was also a new set of featurs or so I think it's new that allows you to connect mutiple domains to your site so if you wanted you could
have professorcool dot come redirect to your site if you owned the domain.

- I can manage content using established workflows.

My group continued to discuss through group me and used our old ways of communication. I decided to convert the workflows we know to my personal life with Skateboarding to see if
it could still apply to something as unpredictable as that and to my surprise it did. I made a list of everything I needed to learn step by step to land my first tre-flip from 
how I should flick my feet to how high i need to bring my knees up and I practiced everything step by step all week and ultimately landed a single one on Saturday which
means the structured workflows in our class does in fact translate into non-technology based task pretty well.

 - I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
 
 This week I learned how to connect to a LINUX server from my half Nintendo 3DS which was actually really pointless but I saw a tutorial on TIKTOK and thought 
 "Hey that would be cool to try" so i tried it and it worked but only barely I couldn't even get basic level stuff like commands to work properly which may be because I'm new
 to LINUX so I'm not sure.
 
 - I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

I continued using the same forums that I have been using over this semaster and they all worked quite well for this week.
