# this week in ICT 302

<br>

  - I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
  
This week I learned HTML doesn't work in HUGO unless you get extremly lucky so I researched for external sources that will guided me to learning how to translate HTML into hugo compatible lines.

<br>

  - I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
  
  I didn't progress here this week
  
  <br>
  
  - I can manage content using established workflows
    
This past week i purchased a nice <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-32-led-curved-qhd-freesync-monitor-with-hdr/6375331.p?skuId=6375331" target="_top">Curved Monitor</a> and it's signifigantly larger than my previous monitor which allowed me to have 3 windows open and speed up my work.

<br>

  - I can describe and compare content management systems.
  
  This week I have learned I do not like HUGO and it is at the bottom of my list of prefered website management systems and now I have a level 0 site to compare too when discussing most useful Content management systems.

<br>

  - I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
  
  This week I learned Markdown which I never really knew of before because I always thought it was always just called HTML I didn't know there was sub-names for HTML features. The term markdown is what led me to finding ways I can find work around to allow HTML like concepts to work on HUGO


<hr>

This week was simple yet frustrating because my prior knowledge was of little use but that is exciting because that means as I suffer using HUGO I'll improve my problem solving skills as well as expanding my web development knowledge as I'm encountering problems I've never seen before.
