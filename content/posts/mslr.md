# This week in ICT 302
- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
 
I've learned quite a bit more than I expected. At the begining I saw we would be doing web design and immidiately brushed it off as easy but I didn't expect that HUGO wouldn't
work with HTML or that wordpress was static and was hit or miss so I was forced to learn workarounds in order to get the same task done.
 
 - I can describe and compare content management systems.

In the now 10 weeks(since I'm late lol) that we've been in this class I've learned quite a bit about Content Management Systems weather it's been by using them or the definintions barker has given us or
even the course readings. I've learned more on what a CMS is this semaster than I did before and how broaodly the term is used while also being so tightly compact into what it could be.

- I can manage content using established workflows.
This semaster we have worked in groups and although in a traditional class this wouldn't be that hard but this semaster is unlike any we've done before both for teacehrs and students
and because of this we've had to adapt and made great use of group me, as well as microsoft teams as a class. Microsoft teams is cool but it's not that good for communication but when 
you assing task and hold information in it it's fine however groupme is the opposite it's great for communication but bad for setting up a workflow. This semaster has also taught me to work with others in
a more meaningful manner where before I hated it more than anything.

 - I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

 I've not really used any new technology in class itself but I have used what I learned in the class to make new technology outside of class. I did extensive research into
 markup language outside of HTML and PHP and it lead me to a new markup language set all related to cyber security which I've taken an interest into over this semaster and I've learned
 quite a bit on how these markup languages are used and even took a online learning 4 week class on it at an online learning website.
 
 - I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
 
As I mentioned earlier the course challanged me in new ways such as HTML not working properly on HUGO and wordpress which lead me to finding many more forums and youtubers who 
have created guides and walkthroughs for walk arounds to make what you wanted in the wordpress post or the hugo page. THis has taught me quite a bit on self trouble shooting and 
solving my own problems in web design.
