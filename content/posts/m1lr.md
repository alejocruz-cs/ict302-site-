After the first week of class I can create github repositories, I can set up sites using hugo and netlify, I can communicate on microsoft teams and I can find new sources online to help me when running into problems.
I can identify and define a few new key concepts in content management.
I have not yet learned to compare content management systems.
I can manage content using github which i believe is an established workflow.
I can use hugo and netlify to employ new technologies such as site deploying for content management.
I can find ways to assist me in self learning our task.
