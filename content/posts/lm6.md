# This week in ICT 302

- I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

I started working with wordpress and learned about a new CMS.
 - I can describe and compare content management systems.

This week I learned about wordpress and can now compare it hugo. Since you can code on the site itself it makes it easier than Hugo.
- I can manage content using established workflows.

My group worked in two apps to create the best workflow and discuss our week in an easier way.
 - I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
 
 I began learning how HTML works with Wordpress which is differnt than Hugo and differnt than coding vanilla HTML
 - I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

I used a site to read and skim which HTML is neccesary in wordpress and which works by default without needing tags.
