<h1> Hello, Nice To Meet You </h1>
<br>
<p>It's interesting facts time! Something I find really cool about myself is I'm bi-racial but by 3 ways while also only being one way. My father is pure blood Otomi 
which is a tribe from mexico while my mother is half Irish and half Cherokee. I think that's cool because it's an odd mix and I would assume other than my brothers and I 
that not many people have that Mix.I collect alot of interesting things primarily video games but I've recently got into collecting anime stuff which is cool but unfortunately 
very expensive so I've not got as much cool stuff as I would had liked. </p>
