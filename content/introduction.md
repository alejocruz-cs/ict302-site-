        hi

It's interesting facts time! I like to make video games and because of that I've learnedmany different programming languages. I collect alot of interesting things primarily video games but I've recently got into collecting anime stuff which is cool but unfortunately very expensive so I've not got as much cool stuff as I would had liked. One more interesting fact here, I tried to add some nice custom CSS to this to make a cool image pulse but this format wouldn't allow me :(

  My top 3 favorite anime are
  
  
-Dragon Ball Super
-Jojo's Bizzare Adventure
-Toradora
